# COPD Signs:  

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a **chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow** from the lungs. Symptoms include breathing difficulty, cough, mucus (sputum) production, and wheezing. It's typically caused by long-term exposure to irritating gases or particulate matter, most often from cigarette smoke. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) makes breathing increasingly more difficult.

# Scoliosis: 

Scoliosis is a sideways curve in your backbone (or spine). Often, it first shows up when you're a child or teenager.

###### The angle of the curve may be small, large, or somewhere in between. But anything that measures more than 10 degrees on an X-ray is considered scoliosis. Doctors may use the letters "C" and "S" to describe the curve.

##### Signs and symptoms of scoliosis may include:
* Uneven shoulders
* One shoulder blade that appears more prominent than the other
* Uneven waist
* One hip higher than the other

If a scoliosis curve gets worse, the spine will also rotate or twist, in addition to curving side to side. This causes the ribs on one side of the body to stick out farther than on the other side.
# Air trapping:

**Air trapping is an important cause of hyperlucent lung. Air trapping has the effect of stretching the alveoli, compressing the capillaries and arterioles, and thus decreasing the pulmonary blood flow.** 

However, this is undoubtedly an oversimplification of the pathologic mechanisms whereby air trapping leads to a decrease in the size of pulmonary vessels.
**Air trapping in chest imaging refers to retention of excess gas (“air”)** in all or part of the lung, especially during expiration, either as a result of complete or partial airway obstruction or as a result of local abnormalities in pulmonary compliance. It may also sometimes be observed in a normal individuals.

# Arotic Elongation: 

The role of ascending aortic elongation in the pathogenesis of Type A aortic dissection (TAD) is largely unclear. Aortic elongation as a risk factor for dissection appears conclusive from a pathophysiological viewpoint.

# Pleural effusion:

**Pleural effusion, sometimes referred to as “water on the lungs,” is the build-up of excess fluid between the layers of the pleura outside the lungs.**
Some patients with pleural effusion have no symptoms, with the condition discovered on a chest x-ray that is performed for another reason. The patient may have unrelated symptoms due to the disease or condition that has caused the effusion.Symptoms of pleural effusion include:
* Chest pain
* Dry, nonproductive cough
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath, or difficult, labored breathing)
* Orthopnea (the inability to breathe easily unless the person is sitting up straight or standing erect)

Pleural effusions are very common, with approximately 100,000 cases diagnosed in the United States each year, according to the National Cancer Institute.

# Linear atelectasis: 


**Linear atelectasis (plural: atelectasis), and also known as discoid or plate atelectasis refers to a focal area of subsegmental atelectasis that has a linear shape.** Linear atelectasis is a focal area of subsegmental atelectasis with a linear shape. Linear atelectasis may occur as a consequence of subsegmental bronchial obstruction. Linear atelectasis may appear to be horizontal, oblique, or perpendicular and is very common. Atelectasis is one of the most common breathing (respiratory) complications after surgery. It's also a possible complication of other respiratory problems, including cystic fibrosis, lung tumors, chest injuries, fluid in the lung, and respiratory weakness. You may develop atelectasis if you breathe in a foreign object.

Atelectasis can make breathing difficult, particularly if you already have lung disease. Treatment depends on the cause and severity of the collapse.


# Callus Rib fractures:
**Callus Rib fractures are most common traumatic chest injury.They are mostly important for their associated morbidity including pneumothorax, hemothorax, lacerations of the liver or spleen, pneumonia or atelectasis from splinting.** Rib fractures classically take at least 6 weeks to heal, some lasting for up to 6 months before completely pain free. As the rib ends become displaced over time and bony callus begins to form, the fracture may become more evident on follow-up examination. Callus formation may produce nodular densities in the rib at the site of healing which should not be confused for a pulmonary nodule.

# Kyphosis- 

**Kyphosis is an exaggerated, forward rounding of the back.** It can occur at any age but is most common in older women.

Age-related kyphosis is often due to weakness in the spinal bones that causes them to compress or crack. Other types of kyphosis can appear in infants or teens due to malformation of the spine or wedging of the spinal bones over time.

Mild kyphosis causes few problems. Severe kyphosis can cause pain and be disfiguring. Treatment for kyphosis depends on your age, and the cause and effects of the curvature.

In addition to causing back pain, kyphosis may cause:

Breathing problems. Severe kyphosis can put pressure on the lungs.


# Hiatal Hernia:  

**A hiatal hernia occurs when the upper part of the stomach pushes through an opening in the diaphragm and into the chest cavity.** The diaphragm is the thin muscle wall that separates the chest cavity from the abdomen.

A hiatal hernia is when your stomach bulges up into your chest through an opening in your diaphragm, the muscle that separates the two areas. The opening is called the hiatus, so this condition is also called a hiatus hernia.

There are two main types of hiatal hernias: sliding and paraesophageal.

Ordinarily, your esophagus (food pipe) goes through the hiatus and attaches to your stomach. In a sliding hiatal hernia, your stomach and the lower part of your esophagus slide up into your chest through the diaphragm. Most people with hiatal hernias have this type.

A paraesophageal hernia is more dangerous. Your esophagus and stomach stay where they should be, but part of your stomach squeezes through the hiatus to sit next to your esophagus. Your stomach can become squeezed and lose its blood supply. Your doctor might call this a strangulated hernia.

# Vascular Hilar enlargement:

Vascular Hilar enlargement reflects one of 4 types of processes:
* Lymphadenopathy and tumors
* Pulmonary venous hypertension
* Pulmonary arterial hypertension
* Increased pulmonary blood flow


# Calcified Granuloma:

**calcified granuloma is a specific type of tissue inflammation that has become calcified over time.** When something is referred to as “calcified,” it means that it contains deposits of the element calcium. Calcium has a tendency to collect in tissue that is healing. 

The formation of granulomas is often caused by an infection. During an infection, immune cells surround and isolate foreign material, such as bacteria. Granulomas can also be caused by other immune systems or inflammatory conditions. They’re most commonly found in the lungs. But they can also be found in other organs of the body, such as the liver or spleen.
